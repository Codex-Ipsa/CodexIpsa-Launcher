An experimental Minecraft launcher which is designed for playing older versions and different editions of the game.<br>
It currently supports all available versions of Java Edition and Xbox 360 Edition, while also having a few MinecraftEdu versions.<br>
Java Edition also has a MultiMC-like modding options (replace minecraft.jar, add to minecraft.jar) and you can easily install modloaders with just two clicks.<br><br>

## Warning
I highly recommend not looking at the source code if you want to learn how a minecraft launcher works. (Code is completely shit, but hey It Just Worksâ„¢)
